# vmpooler-bitbar

## What is this?

Vmpooler-bitbar is plugin for [@matryer's BitBar application](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) built on top of the [go-bitbar](https://github.com/johnmccabe/go-bitbar), and [go-vmpooler](https://github.com/johnmccabe/go-vmpooler) libraries which shows the status of all of your vmpooler instances and allows quick access to actions such as ssh'ing to a node or deleting an instance... and more.

Too much talk, have a look at it in action:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- You must have a vmpooler token, see [generating a token](#generating-a-token) if you don't already have one.
- for the SSH to vmpooler instance action to work you should have the vmpooler ssh key added to the ssh agent, `ssh-add /path/to/priv/key`.

### Install BitBar

If you don't already have BitBar installed you can install using `brew` or by grabbing a release directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/releases/tag/v1.9.1). If you already have BitBar installed you can jump to installing and running the plugin.

    brew cask install bitbar

You can now start BitBar from the `Applications` folder or:

    open /Applications/BitBar.app

If this is your first time installing BitBar you will be prompted to choose/create a plugins directory, for example `~/Documents/bitbar_plugins/`.

Any executable scripts copied to this directory will be rendered in the menubar by BitBar and it is here we will copy the vmpooler-bitbar script.

### Install vmpooler-bitbar

Install using the provider Homebrew tap.

    $ brew tap johnmccabe/vmpooler-bitbar
    $ brew install vmpooler-bitbar

### Generating a Token

IF you already have a token you can jump to the next section, if not run the following command:

    $ vmpooler-bitbar token

Follow the prompts, you will be asked for the following:

- vmpooler API endpoint (for example, `https://vmpooler.mycompany.net/api/v1`)
- username (your LDAP username, for example `joe.bloggs`)
- password (your LDAP password, for example, `password1`)

Your token will be printed to stdout:

    Token generated: pop448v0ztnwta3c964pifngrmk8ea4u

### Configuring

Before vmpooler-bitbar becomes available you must configure the plugin:

    $ vmpooler-bitbar config

Follow the prompts, pressing `?` for more details of each field, you will be asked for the following:

- vmpooler API endpoint (for example, `https://vmpooler.mycompany.net/api/v1`)
- vmpooler token (for example, `kpy2fn8sgjkcbyn896yilzqxwjlnfake`)

Once configured you can then make the plugin available to BitBar:

    $ vmpooler-bitbar install

You will be prompted for a refresh interval, I recommend using the default `30s` recommendation.

If you wish to alter the refresh interval you can just run the `vmpooler-bitbar install` command a second time.

Note: When installing for the fist time you will need to manually restart the BitBar App, or select Preferences/Refresh all from its dropdowns.

## Tips

### Copying Hostname etc
To copy displayed text to the clipboard just click on the item in the menu, this is currently supported for:

- VM hostname (note that the full fqdn will be copied)
- Any Status or Tag entries in the VM submenu

### Using iTerm2 instead of OSX Terminal
To use iTerm2 you must first configure it as described in the _'How do I set iTerm2 as the handler for ssh:// links'_ section of the [iTerm2 FAQ page](http://iterm2.com/faq.html).

If after making the changes above the OSX Terminal continues to open then you should run the following command to rebuild the launch services DB (via [iTerm2 issue #5022](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/5022))

    /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user

## Troubleshooting

### Errors thrown during brew install
If you encounter the following error:

    Error: Cask 'bitbar' definition is invalid: Bad header line: parse failed

You will need to fix your brew cask before reattempting to install BitBar.

    brew uninstall --force brew-cask; brew update
